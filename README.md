## About AimGod

AimGod is developed because of the fact that there is no FPS aiming training app on macOS. It is a light project designed for macOS users. You can train your aiming skills in AimGod using a mouse. Building with Unity, AimGod is a native Apple Silicon Application which can run at max fps on any Apple Silicon mac. 

## Notes

1. press Command + Q to quit the game.

2. This is a very early version. AimGod only has very limited functions and you can only shoot at one target in this game. But no doubt you can train your aim skills using a mouse. This is especially useful for those who have never used a mouse all their life, me for example.

    If you are switching to mouse for FPS gaming on Windows but have been using macOS with a trackpad all your life, I bet this is extremely useful!
    
3. Note that a Windows release is also available. (Just for fun lol...)
